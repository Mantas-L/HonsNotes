title: LLM Tutors Honors Project notes
---
This site will be used as the collection of notes for my LLM Tutors honors project. I will be using the zettlekasten note taking approach.

## Sections
### Permanent
This contains the final, concise and context independent ideas. These ideas will be used together to create the final argument and plan for the project.
### Questions
This section contains all the questions I had when reading for or thinking about this project.

### Literature
This section contains notes that describe an idea that directly references to a paper. Each note will have a link to the citation.

### Fleeting
This section contains ideas that I came up with myself, that I would like to look into or consider doing later.

### Resources
This section will contain the bibliography to the things that I read and reference.

### Unrelated
Stuff not directly related to the project itself. Just questions and things I noted down to ask later.
